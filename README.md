# AutoClicker
This is just a very simple autoclicker that will simulate the mouse clicking. It has a neat little UI where you can enter the amount of clicks you want and the time between those clicks. You can enter decimals and really large numbers. It works on Idle games, I tested it with Cookie Clicker. Feel free to expand on this however you like. Use this with caution!
